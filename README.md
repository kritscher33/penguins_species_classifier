# penguins_species_classifier

Penguins species classifier is a pretty run-of-the-mill introductory machine learning project. 
Completed Spring 2022 as the final project in my Python with Applications class. 
The highlights and unique aspects are the decisions and analysis along the way. 

Data was first imported, cleaned, and analyzed with discussion and visuals before any machine learning began. 

The assignment was to create a model with above 95% accuracy on 3 input variables. 
Our group attempted 3 different types of models: 
Support Vector Classification, Nearest Neighbor Classification, and Random Forrest
We used feature selection to pick the most useful variables for each model, 
and complexity selection to fit the model.
The complexity selection process includes some interesting visuals to follow along. 

In total, all three models performed above the 95% cap on unseen data, 
with the random forrest acheiving 100% accuracy. 

The process was then further analyzed using confusion matrices and decision regions for each model. 
I found that this was the most interesting part of the project, 
and our group was particularly proud of our decision regions function.

A more in depth explanation of the project is available within the project itself.
